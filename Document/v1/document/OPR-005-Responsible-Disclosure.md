| DSOVS-OPR-005 |

## 概要

責任ある開示とはセキュリティ脆弱性をソフトウェアベンダーに報告して、公開される前にその問題に対処する機会を与えることです。

脆弱性が迅速かつ効率的に対処され、潜在的な悪意のある悪用を防ぐことができます。

セキュリティ上の弱点を悪用される前に開発者が積極的に対処できるため、責任ある開示はセキュアなソフトウェア開発にとって重要です。

また、アプリケーションをセキュアに維持することで、潜在的な攻撃からユーザーを保護します。

## レベル 0 - 脆弱性開示ポリシーがない

At this level of security maturity, there are no defined ways to receive security vulnerabilities.

## レベル 1 - 脆弱性開示ポリシーが存在する

At level one, the product has a defined responsible disclosure policy with clear instructions on how to send vulnerability reports, as well as a clear definition of scope. 

Typically this will be security e-mail such as (security@company.com) and will processed manually by internal teams.

## レベル 2 - 脆弱性開示はソフトウェアを使用して管理および追跡している

Responsible vulnerabity disclosure enables external security researchers to report vulnerabilities that they have discovered in software. 

It is important for these vulnerabilities to be stored and tracked the same way as internally found vulnerabilities, in order to ensure that they do not slip through the gaps. 

This helps ensure that all issues are managed accordingly and that the vulnerabilities reported from external sources make their way into the secure software development lifecycle. 

By properly tracking and managing these issues with issue tracking software, developers can ensure that any potential security threats are addressed quickly and effectively. 

This helps ensure that applications remain secure and that users can trust the software they are using.

## レベル 3 - 協調的脆弱性開示プログラムが存在する

A coordinated vulnerability disclosure program is critical for the maturity of a secure software development lifecycle.

This program helps ensure that any vulnerabilities discovered in software are addressed quickly and effectively, while also helping to build trust between software users and developers. 

By providing an organized and standardized framework for vulnerability disclosure, firms can demonstrate their commitment to security and provide transparency around the process. 

Additionally, by coordinating with other organizations, firms can benefit from the expertise and knowledge of others. This helps ensure that all vulnerabilities are managed accordingly and that secure software development is the priority.

## [SECURITY.TXT](https://github.com/securitytxt/security-txt)

security.txt provides a way for websites to define security policies. The security.txt file sets clear guidelines for security researchers on how to report security issues. security.txt is the equivalent of robots.txt, but for security issues.
